Bar Stock Exchange (BSE) - Project Summary

## Project Overview

Bar Stock Exchange (BSE) is an innovative web-based mobile application designed to revolutionize the food and drink ordering experience in restaurants, cafes, and bars. The project replaces traditional hardcopy menus with a digital solution that allows customers to scan a QR code, browse menu items, place orders, and make payments‚Äîall without requiring waiter intervention. What sets this application apart is its unique stock market-themed approach to drink pricing, where beverage prices dynamically fluctuate in real-time based on demand algorithms, creating an interactive and gamified ordering experience.
